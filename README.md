# __YARN HTML PRESENTATION__

This is a html presentation about Yarn that I made for my company in order to show pro and cons to integrate inside an internal project.

---

## __What is inside__

I use [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) framework to build it.<br>
(slides are written in italian)

---

## __Installation__

From the directory of the project run `npm install && bower install`

---

## __Usage__

Once everything is installed, use grunt from the terminal to start the build tasks.
The Gruntfile expose these tasks:

- `grunt serve` (start the project locally)

---

## __To do__

- [ ] English translation

---

## __Contributing__

- Fork it!
- Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
- Submit a pull request
